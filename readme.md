## OneDrive Explorer sample web app

This is a modified version of the following GitHub repository:
* https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-explorer-js

I've copied only the relevant files, and updated the code to work with a OneDrive personal account. To see it in action, see the following link:

To test the login, click the 'Sign in to OneDrive' link on the upper right.

## This demo requires an MS Azure account
